<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

With this application you can manage your notes. Add new notes, set an expiration date and a priority. Your daily tasks are marked, so you never lose track of your daily tasks. 

Sort your notes by creation date, finished date, priority or simply list your completed tasks in ascending or descending order.
